Squirrel Datasets Documentation
===============================
`Squirrel Datasets <https://github.com/merantix-momentum/squirrel-datasets-core>`_ is an extension of the Squirrel platform for data transform, access, and discovery.
It includes common drivers for public datasets, which are ready to use along with data preprocessing logic.

- A good way to get started is with our `Tutorials <https://github.com/merantix-momentum/squirrel-datasets-core/tree/main/examples>`_.
- A great feature of squirrel-datasets-core is that you can easily load data from common databases such as `Huggingface <https://huggingface.co/>`_, `Activeloop Hub <https://www.activeloop.ai/>`_ and `Torchvision <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html>`_ with one line of code. And you get to enjoy all of Squirrel's benefits for free! Check out the :doc:`documentation <driver_integration>` on how to interface with these libraries.
- Visit the official `Squirrel Documentation <https://squirrel-core.readthedocs.io>`_ on more information how to use Squirrel.
