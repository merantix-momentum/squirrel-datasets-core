Squirrel Datasets Documentation
===============================
`Squirrel Datasets <https://github.com/merantix-momentum/squirrel-datasets-core>`_ is an extension of the Squirrel platform for data transform, access, and discovery.
It includes common drivers for public datasets, which are ready to use along with data preprocessing logic.
A good way to get started is with our `Tutorials <https://github.com/merantix-momentum/squirrel-datasets-core/tree/main/examples>`_. 
Visit the official `Squirrel Documentation <https://squirrel-core.readthedocs.io>`_ on more information how to use Squirrel.
