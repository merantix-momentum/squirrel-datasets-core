Squirrel Datasets
=================

`squirrel-datasets-core` is a hub where the user can 1) explore existing datasets registered in the data mesh by other users and 2) preprocess their datasets and share them with other users. As an end user, you will
be able to load many publically available datasets with ease and speed with the help of `squirrel`, or load and preprocess
your own datasets with the tools we provide here. 

For preprocessing, we currently support Spark as the main tool to carry out the task.

Please see our [documentation](https://squirrel-datasets-core.readthedocs.io) for further details.
